Extra Credit Questions

Question 1 (Part 1)

	SELECT COUNT(event) as “NumberOfEvents”, EXTRACT(month FROM event) as “Month”
	FROM events
	WHERE city='Seattle'
	GROUP BY EXTRACT(month FROM event);

Question 1 (Part 2)
	
	SELECT t1.Month
	FROM (SELECT MAX(t.NumberOfEvents), t.Month
       		FROM (SELECT COUNT(event) as NumberOfEvents,
           			EXTRACT(month FROM event) as Month
            		FROM events
            		WHERE city='Seattle'
            		GROUP BY EXTRACT(month FROM event)
            		) as t
     	) as t1;

Question 2

1. The calculation of median is incorrect. The vector of data should be sorted and then the median should be the middle most value in case of an odd-length vector or the average of the two middle values in case of even-length vector.
2. Variance should be calculated as :
	variance += (values[i] ‐ median)** 2 / len(values)
3. Also, standard deviation is the square root of variance but the script calculates the standard deviation as the square of the variance.
